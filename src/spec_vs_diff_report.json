  "summary": "The diff fully implements REQ-1. A navigation link to the Figma design site was added to Nav.tsx, opening in a new tab with proper security attributes. The link appears in both desktop and mobile navigation views alongside existing links, following the same pattern as the 'Reflect & Create' external link.",

  "hallucinated_features": [
    {
      "description": "The Figma link was labeled 'Design Inspiration' rather than using a neutral label like 'Figma' or 'Design'",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest does not specify what label text to use for the navigation link. The implementation chose 'Design Inspiration' which adds semantic meaning not requested in the requirements.",
