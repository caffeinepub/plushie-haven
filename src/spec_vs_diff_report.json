The file summary explicitly states 'community and gallery sections have been removed from the homepage.' The hero section now only contains an 'Explore Articles' button, and the feature cards section references 'Plushie Moments' (a gallery preview section) but no longer includes navigation links or CTAs to the community board or gallery pages themselves.",
