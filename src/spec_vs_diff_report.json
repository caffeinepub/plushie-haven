  "summary": "Frontend changes implement correct profile routing in the directory UI, URL-driven profile editing, improved own-profile loading behavior, and a new teddy storybook gallery item with lightbox rendering. Backend changes shown are truncated and do not provide clear evidence that the profiles directory listing now returns each profile’s Principal as required.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Backend directory listing must include the owner Principal for each profile so the frontend can route each card to `/profiles/$principal`.",
      "reason": "The frontend now expects `actor.listDirectoryProfiles()` to return tuples of `(Principal, UserProfile)` and maps them to `{ principal, profile }`, but the backend diff excerpt is truncated and does not show `listDirectoryProfiles` (or any change proving it returns principals).",

        "backend/main.mo (truncated; listDirectoryProfiles not shown)"
