  "summary": "Implemented safe, allowlisted video embedding by extending token-based URL parsing to emit video tokens for YouTube/Vimeo and rendering them via a responsive iframe component inside LinkifiedText. Non-video URLs remain standard external links. CommunityBoardPage usage is asserted via a summary file, but actual code changes for CommunityBoardPage/PostComments rendering are not fully visible in the provided diff summary (PostComments is truncated).",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Apply video-embed rendering consistently anywhere the app currently uses LinkifiedText to render user-generated text (including CommunityBoardPage post title/body and PostComments comment content).",
      "reason": "LinkifiedText now supports video tokens, and PostComments imports LinkifiedText, but the diff for PostComments is truncated and no concrete diff for CommunityBoardPage is shown—so consistent application to post titles/bodies and comment content cannot be fully verified from the provided diff summary alone.",

        "frontend/src/components/community/PostComments.tsx (truncated)",

    {
      "description": "Updated frontend-file-summaries.txt with broad app feature descriptions beyond the requested video-embed change.",
