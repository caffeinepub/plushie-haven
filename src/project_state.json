    "Visual theme direction updated: prioritize an ‘adorable’ aesthetic with a pink + baby blue palette (supersedes prior guidance to avoid blue/purple-dominant palettes).",
    "Events direction updated: replace static/seeded events with user-submitted events (users can add events).",
    "Theme update: use exact palette—backgrounds #FFFFFF or #FDFDFD; primary accents/baby blue #89CFF0 or #A2DFFE (prominent on buttons/borders/cards/highlights); tertiary accents/pink #FFB6C1 or #FFD1DC (used sparingly); text #4A90E2 or #333333; rounded corners + gentle shadows; avoid dark/edgy tones; apply site-wide consistently.",
    "Header branding: include a cute pastel teddy bear with a bow in the header, matching the baby blue + pink palette.",
    "UI polish: do not leave unexplained placeholder shapes (e.g., empty circle/square). Replace with intended branding/icons or remove from the layout.",
    "Home page hero/title area: replace the small circular placeholder to the left of the large blue “Plushie Haven” text (above the tagline paragraph) with the teddy bear logo (do not leave it empty).",
    "Community Board moderation direction: designate the currently authenticated Internet Identity principal as the admin (for now); admins can edit/delete any post, while regular users can delete only their own posts.",
    "Coloring section decision updated: remove the entire Coloring page/section from the site (remove the /coloring route and its UI).",
    "Profiles direction updated: remove the Profiles section/pages from the site (remove profile directory + individual profile pages and any related navigation entry points).",
    "Admin request: user wants their currently authenticated Internet Identity principal to be made admin so they can delete other users’ Community Board posts (use the existing claim-admin flow; no hard-coded principal)."
