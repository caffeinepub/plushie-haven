  "architectural_notes": [
    "Visual theme direction updated: prioritize an ‘adorable’ aesthetic with a pink + baby blue palette (supersedes prior guidance to avoid blue/purple-dominant palettes).",
    "Events direction updated: replace static/seeded events with user-submitted events (users can add events).",
    "Theme update: use exact palette—backgrounds #FFFFFF or #FDFDFD; primary accents/baby blue #89CFF0 or #A2DFFE (prominent on buttons/borders/cards/highlights); tertiary accents/pink #FFB6C1 or #FFD1DC (used sparingly); text #4A90E2 or #333333; rounded corners + gentle shadows; avoid dark/edgy tones; apply site-wide consistently.",
    "Header branding: include a cute pastel teddy bear with a bow in the header, matching the baby blue + pink palette.",
    "UI polish: do not leave unexplained placeholder shapes (e.g., empty circle/square). Replace with intended branding/icons or remove from the layout.",
    "Home page hero/title area: replace the small circular placeholder to the left of the large blue “Plushie Haven” text (above the tagline paragraph) with the teddy bear logo (do not leave it empty).",
    "Community Board moderation direction: designate the currently authenticated Internet Identity principal as the admin (for now); admins can edit/delete any post, while regular users can delete only their own posts.",
    "Profiles direction: build both individual profile pages and a public profile directory; profiles are publicly viewable but only editable when logged in; users are hidden from the directory by default unless they opt in (and can opt out). Profile fields include avatar, display name, bio, links, and plushie collection images (and future optional fields).",
    "Header account display: when signed in, show the user’s Profile display name in the header (replacing the person icon); when signed out, show the existing Sign In UI.",
    "Coloring section decision updated: remove the entire Coloring page/section from the site (remove the /coloring route and its UI)."

  "known_issues": [
    "Random empty circle and square placeholders appear in the UI; user requested to fill them with intended content or remove them.",
