The link should appear in both the desktop navigation list and mobile sheet navigation, positioned after existing navigation items. Use target='_blank' and rel='noopener noreferrer' for security. Style consistently with the existing external link pattern, using appropriate visual indicators (such as ExternalLink icon) to show it opens in a new tab. Ensure the link text is descriptive (e.g., 'Design Inspiration' or 'Figma Design') and maintains the navigation's existing styling patterns."
